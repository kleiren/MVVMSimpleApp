# MVVMSimpleApp
Simple demonstration app to check "when to run" by temperature in a location, allowing to change location checked by tapping on a map.

- MVVM
- Done both with XML views and fragments and in Jetpack Compose without fragments. 
- A bit of unit testing using Mockito.
- Openweather api for temperatures and google maps api to choose a location.
- No Retrofit or other libraries to simplify api calls, only android basic ones.
